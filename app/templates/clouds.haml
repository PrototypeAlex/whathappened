    Over a ten year period New Zealand, on average, receives 119 days of rain per year, when broken down even further there's a 28% chance of rain on a summers day and and a 37% chance of rain on a winters day. Though on a brighter note, New Zealand receives on average 2010 hours of sunshine per year, which should be ample time to get your dose of Vitamin D.
