<h1>Rain by the bucketful</h1><p class="introduction">Most areas of New Zealand have between 600 and 1600 mm of rainfall, spread throughout the year with a dry period during the summer. Over the northern and central areas of New Zealand more rainfall falls in winter than in summer, whereas for much of the southern part of New Zealand, winter is the season of least rainfall.</p><div class="graphics"><div class="infographic"><div class="number">1300mm</div><div class="icon icon-rain"></div><div class="what">Of Rainfall</div><div class="extra">Per year on average</div></div></div><svg id="js-new-zealand-svg"></svg><div id="js-new-zealand-legend"></div><div id="js-city-line-chart"></div>
