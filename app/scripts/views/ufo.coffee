Duration of sightings approximately 8-10 minutes. Three witnesses observed an incredibly intense, bright orange light moving slowly towards them from the Taradale hills area. As they watched, the light suddenly veered sharply left, climbed rapidly upwards and disappeared. Then two similar bright orange lights appeared and followed the same flight path, and these were followed by another two similar lights behaving as the previous ones. As the last two lights were in the climb, another single bright orange light appeared and followed them along the same flight path. All lights appeared at low level initially and then moved across the sky on a north to south track, before disappearing to the west. All lights appeared to be round and very large, and the witnesses advised that the sharp turn the lights made when veering left could not be made by an aircraft. The brilliancy of the lights did not change during the observation, and there was no associated noise, even though the lights seemed fairly close to the witnesses. Possibly Chinese lanterns, although the witnesses were adamant they were not. "},

The intensity of the light was consistent, with no variations in colour or brightness. There was no sound associated with the sighting. The light initially travelled slowly across the sky from Northwest to North, becoming stationary for a short time. At this point the witness called her son to come and observe the light. The light was still stationary when he came out to watch it, then it began moving again in a northerly direction before becoming stationary again for a couple of minutes. From that position the light sped away, becoming smaller until it disappeared from view in the distance. "},

At around 2.45 pm the witness looked out the window and noticed a black disc shaped object stationary in a small gap between clouds, high in the sky. She watched the object for about 1 minute before deciding to stand up to get a better view through another window. The object moved into the clouds and disappeared, while the witness kept her eyes on that spot. It reappeared from the cloud moving at a slow pace across the sky for around 2 minutes. The witness knew it was not playing or helicopter because of its manner of movement. She reached for her phone to see if she could zoom in on the object, but when she looked back out the window, it was gone. "},

The witnesses were driving home northbound on Peachgrove Road toward Five Cross Roads, Hamilton, when they saw a very bright oval star-like object hovering close-by in the sky. They estimated object was around 200-300 metres distant, at a height of approximately 400 metres. The object hovered for a couple seconds then started moving slowly sideways while shining a brilliant white beam of light down onto adjacent tree-tops. The witnesses initially thought it could be a helicopter, but as they got nearer and lowered the car window, there was no sound to be heard. The witnesses could make out a solid disc-shaped object in the centre of the brilliant white light being emitted. The brilliancy of the light did not change during the sighting. The witnesses drove on feeling scared and uncomfortable about watching any further and so lost sight of the object. "},

Duration of sighting 40-50 seconds. The witness had just arrived home and was checking the night sky, when he noticed a large bright green ball of light as it appeared in his vision high above the horizon, in the vicinity of the Southern Cross. It tracked across the sky to the north-east at a speed at least twice as fast as a jet airliner. There was no deviation in flight path as the object disappeared over the horizon. Just prior to it disappearing, the witness noticed an orange flash on the right hand side of the ball of green light. UFOCUS NZ comment: possibly a meteor, although the witness stated he is a regular sky-watcher and considers it was not a meteor. "},

Duration of sighting 4 minutes. Two witnesses observed a red pulsing orb of light high in the sky travelling slowly from a north-westerly direction, south east from out at sea well beyond Kapiti Island. The light then changed to a north easterly direction, with occasional irregular changes of direction, disappearing and then reappearing slightly off track. The light then became stationary, tracked north, then North East still continuing to pulse irregularly. Initially the light was seen to pulse at different intervals, at some point is not pulsating at all. The reporting witness described the red light as having a strange intensity to it. This witness is near completion of his commercial pilot's licence and was absolutely sure the light was not an aircraft as no legally required aircraft lighting was visible, and there was no sound. They watched the light until it disappeared from view. The second witness, a skeptic, had no explanation for this anomalous light. "},

Duration of sighting 1-2 minutes. Four witnesses observed a large bright orange light in the northwestern sky, which at first they thought was an aircraft on fire, however the light was ascending, rather than descending. They watched the light as it climbed higher in the sky until it faded from view. They described the bright light as ‘throbbing’ or ‘pulsing’. "},

Duration of sighting 20 minutes. This sighting occurred north of Katikati, near the Waihi Beach/Athenree turn-off. The witness had just let her cat outside when she noticed something flashing brightly which caught her attention. Approximately 1 km away she observed an object hovering just above treetop level, and above a gap between some trees. The object had bright flashing lights which were changing colour and it stayed very still all the time she observed it. While watching the object the witness rang her neighbour several times so he could observe the object as well, however her telephone line seemed to be blocked at the same time she was trying to make contact with someone. She knew her neighbour had binoculars, but she was too scared to cross the road to his house to get them. The witness stated she was shocked by what she had seen and felt her life may be changed forever because of it. Initially she tried to rationalise the object as a satellite or an optical illusion, while all the time she knew by its appearance and close proximity to the ground that it was not a satellite, and that she was actually seeing something anomalous. Initial report only; awaiting illustration from the witness. "},

Duration of sighting approximately 1 minute. The witness saw an unusual bright orange light in the sky and initially thought it must be an unusual plane. She pulled over to the side of the road to have a closer and longer look at it and tried to ascertain if there were any flashing/strobing lights, but there were none. She watched it move across the sky until it was out of view from her position. She then proceeded and spotted the light again continuing on its same course. The orange light was moving at about the same speed as an aircraft, however it became stationary a number of times before moving on smoothly. The second sighting of the light was witnessed by a family member. "},

Duration of sighting approximately 5 minutes. Several witnesses were outside their house when they saw a glowing orange “burning” light in the sky travelling due west from the Eastern Ranges. The light moved in a radical fashion, sometimes hovering, sometimes climbing, then moving on a horizontal flight path towards the east before climbing vertically at a rapid rate until out of sight. It resembled a glowing aircraft with 'burning wings' or glowing appendages. Initially the light appeared from close to the horizon, moving at the speed of an aircraft. UFOCUS NZ comment: We have received numerous bright orange light reports over the last few years. More recently, we have been receiving reports of large orange lights with glowing appendages or ‘pods’. "},

Duration of sighting 5-10 minutes. Two witnesses observed an intense bright orange ball of light coming into view and moving very quickly from east to west over Otaki. The light rose in an arc but did not diminish in size and seemed to level out as it continued out over the sea towards Kapiti Island. The size, shape and intensity of the light did not alter as it passed. As the light was brilliant orange and there was no noise from the object, both witnesses ruled out helicopter, aircraft and hot air balloon as logical explanations, and commented the speed of light was much faster than any of these. About 30 seconds later after the first had disappeared over the sea, another two orange lights approached following exactly the same flight path and travelling close together. As these lights moved out over the sea, another two orange lights appeared. All travelled the same flight path, at the same speed and height from beginning to end. As the lights passed their position, the witnesses had the impression of a shape within the orange glow and described this as ‘a short tail, like a truncated tadpole’, with a small pulsating light at the end of it.

Duration of sighting approximately 1 minute. The witness saw a red/orange single ball of light travelling at speed from west to east. She initially thought it was an aircraft, however there was no noise whatsoever and the colour of the light was sharp, vivid and bright. Radiating out from the orb were red/orange spikes of colour which became hazy around the edges, but still intensely bright, as the light traversed the sky. The witness’s view was clear and unimpeded and she watched the light move from half way across the sky to the horizon, which took approximately 1 minute. The light moved at a constant altitude and speed but with a slight jerking movement. "},

Duration of sightings approximately 3 minutes. The prime witness initially noticed an orange/red light in the sky and initially thought it was an unusually bright view of Venus. However the light was twice the size and brightness of Venus, and was slowly moving up from the horizon, so he thought that it may have been an aircraft. He then noticed a second similar light to the left of the first, and thought the lights were too close to be aircraft. Within a few more seconds, 3 more similar lights came into view over the northern horizon, estimated to be some 30km distant. He called his brother and wife and son outside to look. It became clear to the witnesses that they were not viewing aircraft, as the lights were pulsating orange (not flashing) and made no noise as they moved slowly north. Four of the lights suddenly disappeared or became obscured by cloud, but did not reflect any light on the clouds. Only one visible light was left, and this last light soon disappeared in a similar manner. The witness then telephoned a friend who lived in the same street to describe what he had seen, and while on the phone they both witnessed one more similar object come over the horizon and vanish in the same manner. All lights moved slowly along the same flight path, and maintained the same size and brilliancy throughout the sighting period. They left no tails, and the witness was positive that the lights were not Chinese lanterns as they were too bright and too far distant. "},

Duration of sighting 5-8 seconds. The witness stated he lives high on a hill above a river valley with a 180° view of the surrounding area. He was working on his computer when his attention was attracted to several bright white objects moving across the sky in a westerly direction, travelling in unison, one behind the other. The witness guessed there were four or five but they were travelling so fast there could have been more. They were travelling approximately at the height of a skyscraper, and were approximately 600 m away from the observer. The witness assumed they were birds but as he looked closely, he managed to catch a clear view of the last two objects and realised they were not birds. He described them as being brighter than a light bulb. The bright balls of light made no audible sound as an aircraft would. "},

Duration of sighting 30 minutes. Two witnesses, located in Mangere, were outside having a cigarette when they saw lights in the sky to the south over Takanini/Papakura. The lights remained stationary for at least 30 minutes, during which time the witnesses saw the object turn, revealing the form of a large triangular shape outlined by red, orange, blue, and white coloured lights. During the time the witnesses observed the lights one witness began to feel nauseated and had to go inside briefly. The second witness, his mother, also felt unwell while watching the lights, to the extent she had to hold onto the wall of the house as she went inside. UFOCUS NZ comment: The reporting witness experienced a close proximity sighting of a UFO in the past which caused shock, nausea, and electrical effects. The nausea experienced during this sighting may well have been triggered by memories of this previous event. However, this does not explain why his mother felt unwell as well. "},

Duration of sighting 60-70 seconds. The witness was in bed with the flu when she experienced the inexplicable urge to get out of bed and look out the window. Coming in over the sea from a north-westerly direction she observed three separate formations of red lights at medium altitude, moving slowly towards her position in the direction of the Tararua Hills. The separate formations were in a line across the sky and there was no noise associated with the sighting. The three formations of red lights moved away to the southwest, climbing faster than a normal passenger plane, and were enveloped by cloud. The last light to enter the cloud gave off a silver flash. The witness rushed to grab her camera and took two photos as the lights ascended however these are marred by camera movement. "},

Duration of sighting approximately 3-5 minutes. The prime witness noticed a small slow moving light similar to a star, traveling in a south to north easterly direction. The object initially appeared low on the horizon, and as it ascended to pass over the witness's house, it increased in brilliance, becoming a big ball of orange/yellow light, brighter than any other object in the sky. The witness called her partner to see the object that was now the size of the witness's thumb nail at arm's length. As they watched, the object's speed increased rapidly, and its size decreased as it disappeared on an approximately 45 degree upward flight path. The light left no trail, and maintained the same brilliancy until just prior to disappearing high in the upper atmosphere. There was no noise or flashing lights associated with the passage of the object. "},

Duration of sighting 4.5 minutes. At 9.33 pm the witness was out on the street with his dog. Looking back towards his house he noticed a large orange orb of light above and beyond tree-line, moving in the direction of his house (from North east to the south east, towards Rangitoto Island). He watched the fast moving light for around 30 seconds and wondered what sort of aircraft it could be. Noticing there were no visible navigation lights, he wondered if it was a flare. However the light moved at varying speeds, up and down and at acute angles, pulsing and executing the changes in direction quickly. The light was an intense orange. The light then moved out over the Gulf at an estimated distance of 4-5 kilometres from Takapuna Beach, whilst gaining altitude at incredible speed. It disappeared into misty rain cloud. Initially the light he observed looked the size of a 20 cent coin held at arm’s length, decreasing to a ‘pin prick’ as it ascended and increased speed. The witness described the light’s speed as being faster than any known aircraft he has seen, and it manoeuvred in angular fashion, changing direction at extreme speed on two occasions during the sighting. Approximately 3 minutes or so into the sighting the witness called his wife to come outside, and she witnessed the last moments before the light disappeared. The witness noticed his dog behaved as if fearful during the event. "},

They observed what they first thought was a plane releasing parachutists, as they could see two objects below and to the left of the main object. However the large disk shaped object was bright white in colour and not moving, and was much higher than a plane releasing parachutists would fly. Continuing to watch, they saw two stationary v-shaped bright white objects to the left, in the eight o'clock position from the main object. These smaller objects moved slightly together in the formation. The reporting witness went down into the cabin to fetch a camera while his friend sailed the yacht. On his return, the two v-shaped objects had gone and the large circular object had climbed and moved further distant and was now close to the base of a large cloud. The objects were airborne in the north east at an elevation of approximately 65° above the horizon, and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 to 20,000 feet.

A few seconds later seven more similar but smaller lights appeared behind the first one. The size of the lights gave the witness the impression that the first light was closer than the others. The witness initially thought the lights were helicopters, as they were at an altitude similar to what a helicopter or small aircraft would be at, but there was no sound. The lights all moved southwards in formation, then appeared to stop. From that point, the witness had the impression that the lights may have moved away very fast to the west, giving the impression of the lights “shrinking” in size and disappearing. The local police advised that they had received several reports of the same lights being sighted. UFOCUS NZ comment: Possibly Chinese lanterns, although the witness is adamant they were not.

Almost immediately, another similar looking object appeared where the first light was initially seen. It subsequently followed the same flight path and movements, vanishing in a similar position. The witness initially thought that it may have been a model aircraft, but the very bright white light which appeared to be semi-circular in form, its erratic movements, and height and distance from the observer would tend to negate this.

The lights were spaced apart, travelling quickly and silently. The lights faded out one by one as they neared Timaru. The witness phoned a friend in another part of town, 1/2 km west of this location, and asked him to look due east for these lights low in the sky over the South Beach. The second witness confirmed the sighting. The reporting witness stated that at one time there were two lights closer together, and one of them delivered what he described as a “large bluish-white ‘pod’, as opposed to a beam of light”, down in a curving direction towards the ocean. This happened in a split-second. UFOCUS NZ comment: We asked the witness if he thought these lights could have been Chinese lanterns. He responded: “This possible explanation in no way fits the bill with the sighting due to the obvious controlled movement that these lights display. The lights ‘turned off’ in total contrast to the fire of a lantern burning out, and all ‘switched off’ upon reaching the same location and coming to a stop. I've never seen the intense colour of those red-orange lights, let alone the shape of them, anywhere.

It was much bigger than an aircraft and this was reinforced by their sighting of an aircraft in the sky during the sighting period, but not near the unidentified object. The object subsequently disappeared from view by slowly moving off and fading away. "},

Duration of sighting one hour. A witness travelling long distance from Kaikoura south, observed a large white light in the sky as she approached the Greta Valley, North Canterbury. She described it as a white misty light surrounding a ‘solid’ white centre. The light was visible throughout the next hour as the witness travelled further south to Woodend and the start of the Northern motorway into Christchurch, where she lost sight of the light due to strong street lighting. During the hour she observed the light, it ascended and descended, sometimes hovering and then travelling quickly across the sky for1/2 – 1 kilometre before stopping and hovering again. At other times the light would travel further south, before returning and sweeping across in front of the witness, moving over distance between the highway and the coastline. Overall, the witness reported the light was visible moving to her left (east) near the sea for most of the hour, the balance of the sighting time taking place to the west or south of her position. She observed the light become stationary at times for 30 seconds and at other times for up to 2 minutes. Occasionally the light was lost from view beyond pine trees. At one point early on in the sighting the witness began to doubt what she was seeing and wondered if she was seeing a light from her dashboard reflected on her windscreen, so she stopped the car, got out, established the light was in fact in the air and watched it for at least 25 minutes. During this time she saw the light move erratically as described above. "},

Duration of sighting 30 to 40 seconds. The witness was sitting outside on her deck when she heard what she first thought was the sound of the plane, but noted the sound was somewhat different - a low, constant thrum with no variation in sound. She observed an object appear beyond the eaves of her house at an estimated height of 100 250 feet. It was a large grey, almost perfect triangular shape, like a thick wedge. It had large white rectangular lights at the back of it that glowed brightly but did not create an external radiant beam (like a headlight of a car would do). It was moving very slowly (when compared to a commercial airliner) from north east to west in the direction of Muriwai Beach and the witness commented if it had been an aircraft it would have fallen out of the sky. The depth of the object from the bottom to the top edges was the same throughout the length and shape of the object. The witness did not observe any undercarriage was wheels and it did not have the usual coloured lights on its wing tips that an aircraft would have. It had no lights at all except at the rear end. The object moved with a point forward, and a flat side of the triangle at the back. The object was lost from view beyond a high hedge. The witness gauged the size of the object as seen in the sky, as being the size of both hands held together at arm’s length. The sighting was witnessed by a second witness who did not wish to be identified. The reporting witness also saw an orange glowing ball of light moving slowly in the sky on the same evening. "},

Duration of sighting approximately 6 seconds. Two witnesses were watching TV when they sighted a massive orange orb fly past their floor-to-ceiling windows. They ran outside and saw that the orb was positioned above adjacent trees and that no sound could be heard. The object was in the northern part of the sky traveling east to west. At one point it stopped, then sped up toward the southwest where it disappeared. One witness belongs to the Auckland Astronomical Society and is familiar with natural atmospheric phenomena, and is positive that the large orange orb seen did not comply with fireball/meteorite criteria.

Duration of sighting several seconds. Two witnesses were sitting on their deck with a clear view across the harbour to Rangitoto Island. They observed a bright orange light moving from above the central city area, north towards the North Shore. During this time the light changed direction erratically a couple of times, and then moved quickly upwards and out of sight. There was no noise associated with the sighting. The witnesses initially thought it was a flare from a boat, but after a few seconds realised it wasn't. The light was low, large and bright orange in colour. "},
      {"time": new Date("March 15, 2012 00:00:00"),"region":"northland","location":"Western Hills, Whangarei, North Island","event":"object with rotating blue, red, white lights","description":"Dark cloudy night sky. Duration of sighting approximately 20 minutes. Two witnesses observed a white light with red and blue lights around it above a hill near their house. At first they thought it was a star, and then realised it was too bright and so considered it may be a helicopter. One witness went outside and noticed there was no sound of an aircraft, and that the light was very bright now and moving slightly. He looked through binoculars and saw a circle of lights rather like a ring of white LEDs, shining in such a way that they were neither pointing downwards or sideways. The ring of lights had red and blue lights rotating around it. The witness called to family members who also observed the lights through binoculars. All witnesses then noticed a second set of lights above and behind the first, which was now getting bigger and descending towards the observers. They also sighted a cluster of disc-shaped luminous objects positioned several hundred metres above the trees on the hill less than 1 km away from the observers. The rotating lights appeared to descend to low level, or land, behind trees on flat farmland nearby. They illuminated the trees in the distance for a few moments as they descended towards ground level. The second cluster of lights the witnesses had observed now moved away from them and became less distinct, before vanishing altogether. The sighting occurred in a rural area and was witnessed by five adult witnesses who were confused by what they had observed. The reporting witnesses stated, “These could not have been helicopters unless they were electric and silent! No aircraft that I know of have rotating red lights like a pinball machine.”  UFOCUS NZ Comment:  Possibly remote controlled hobby planes with LED lights, although the lights were seen to hover and move slowly."},

Duration of sighting approximately 10 minutes. The two witnesses were on the beach watching the stars, when they sighted a small orange light that appeared to be about 4km out to sea, just above the horizon. They initially thought it was a fishing boat, but as they watched, the orange light increased in brilliance and size, and rapidly changed to a sail-type shape, then into a larger hot orange coloured oblong shape with one rounded end. (The oblong shape was described as being the size of the witness's thumb nail with the hand held at arm's length.) The object gave the appearance of being like plasma. As they watched, another similar oblong shape appeared above the first, and both seemed to be linked by a narrow band. This seemed to be expanding towards the witnesses, and this frightened them. They started running down the beach, and when they looked back the oblong lights had disappeared, to be replaced by a very bright white star-like light rising up from the same position. The witnesses could make out a similar oblong solid shape surrounded by the white glow. As this object moved fast upwards on a curved flight path, its brilliance shone on both the adjacent clouds and the sea/beach. There was no sound associated with the lights, and no “tail” or trail behind it. The light finally disappeared as it moved to higher altitudes. The witnesses have previously observed satellites and shooting stars, and were positive the orange light did not fit those categories. "},

Duration of sighting 20 seconds. Two witnesses were leaving a house in South Dunedin when they spotted a bright star-like object with blue, red, and white lights. They were looking south east towards the ocean and the light was moving from south to north. At first the witnesses thought the light must be a satellite, until it began moving erratically in a zigzag motion. This erratic movement was very fast and following this, the light carried on in a northerly direction in a straight line parallel with the horizon.  As it moved further south it lost its intensity and brightness. The sighting lasted 20 seconds and this was the amount of time it took for the light to move from far south to far north, until out of sight. "},

Duration of sighting 30 seconds. The witness’s attention was drawn to a bright pulse of light near a small plane that was flying over eastern Christchurch/Godley Head/banks Peninsular areas. The witness went outside to investigate and saw a bright white light fall vertically in the sky near the aircraft. At first the witness thought something had fallen off the plane, but realised the plane was actually too far away from the light for that to be the case. Shortly after (some 10 to 20 seconds) he saw a dark object moving across the sky away from the area where the light had “stopped falling”. This dark object was heading east to west towards Christchurch. It then lit up very spectacularly with a bright head and fiery tail, like an old-style rocket with sparks out the back. It moved upwards, initially slowly but gathering speed, and finally accelerated very quickly upwards and away, disappearing into the night sky. The witness observed the speed at which it accelerated was faster than a jet could achieve. The witness estimated the light/object was under 2000 feet altitude, at a distance of approximately 10 km. The small aircraft seen in the sky at the time of the fighting was moving away from the light as the light descended, and also when the object accelerated away, so it is possible the pilot did not witness the event.

While searching the sky for a plane, the witness saw a silver/white bullet-shaped object shoot across the sky, from south to north. The object was oval shaped with rounded ends, with no wings or tail. The witness was astonished when not long after she observed another object the same as the first, following it in the same direction from afar. Both objects were travelling at the speed of a jet aircraft.

The light appeared to ‘bounce around’ as it traversed the sky, and moved away from the observer. The witness had seen a similar light earlier in the evening, and again the following night. He rang Auckland’s Stardome Observatory and was told Whenuapai Airbase may have been involved in night activities. However the witness did not think the light resembled an aircraft’s speed or light configuration, or red flare.

Duration of sighting 25-30 minutes. No other aircraft in the sky at the time or sounds of aircraft. The witness was standing on his porch after finishing work late. Looking to the west (Pukekohe/Karaka/Patumahoe area) he noticed a bright yellow light, consistent with the size of a bright star, which he gauged to be travelling slowly from west to east towards his position. He estimated the distance to be 10-15 km away. The light became stationary before moving back in the opposite direction to the west at slow speed. The witness could not hear any sound from the light, as commonly heard from aircraft on flight paths to the west with the wind blowing from that direction. The light suddenly increased in brightness and then disappeared “as if someone had turned a light switch off.”The witness continued to watch the sky and shortly after the light reappeared, but not as bright as it was previously. He sat on a chair to stabilise body movement, so as to ascertain if the light was moving in relation to his surroundings. The light moved east, became stationary briefly, then moved west at a slower speed over a period of 5-10 minutes. The intensity of the light remained consistent. The light made another turn and moved slowly south. After observing the light for a total of 25-30 minutes, the witness saw it ‘switch off’ again (or go behind cloud). The witness is familiar with local aircraft flight paths and stated he had never seen an aircraft in that particular direction or area, and had never observed an aircraft move in this manner. The light was moving over distance at a lower altitude than commercial aircraft on flight paths further northwest. UFOCUS NZ comment: Detailed diagram/map provided. "},
      {"time": new Date("January 08, 2012 00:00:00"),"region":"waikato","location":"Pukeatua, Waikato, North Island","event":"orange light/craft at low level seen on numerous occasions","description":"The witness reported that over the last 8 years he had seen the same airborne object carrying out the same manoeuvres in the same location on various dates, the last one being on Sunday 8/1/12. The sightings usually occur on clear nights around midnight, when the adjacent landscape is visible, giving the witness good reference points to gauge the size and location of the object. Sightings usually last some 3-5 minutes. The object appears from behind a forested hill 3km to the west (position A on the photos), and maintains a level flight path some 500 feet above ground level. It initially appears as a large bright yellow/orange ball of light, which then decreases in brilliancy. It moves down the valley at a speed similar to that of a helicopter. First appearing as a ball of light, the brilliance then diminishes and it becomes a creamy-grey colour. At this point an object is able to be seen within the glow. Using binoculars the witness is able to see a distinct oblong shape with rounded ends, and there also appears to be a row of windows along the centre, as well as a small flashing orange/red light. The object hovers at the southern-most point of the flight path for about a minute, and at this point is the size of half a thumb with hand held at arm’s length, estimated as the size of a large 4-5 seater helicopter. Often the intensity of the glow around the object increases, giving the appearance of a power increase, and making the object difficult to see. The brilliancy then decreases and the object will reappear and move slowly back up the valley to disappear behind the ridge at the position it initially appeared. The witness stated he can easily hear aircraft and helicopters operating in this area, but this object makes no sound at all. The appearance of this light/object sets all the local dogs barking. On one occasion the witness noticed his bedroom was lit up from outside, and looked out the window to see the light/object. On another occasion, neighbours were working late in their shed when they noticed light blazing outside. They turned to investigate and saw the light/object, which immediately disappeared (went out). The witness reports that on these occasions it was as if the light/object “knew what they were thinking,” or that it was being observed. UFOCUS NZ Comment: The valley the object traverses has a stream running through it.  The witness has felt minor earthquakes in his area. We have received a similar report from a professional hunter living in a remote area near Whanganui. He has observed a similar light/object regularly traversing the valley he lives in over a two year period. "},

The object was hovering over Manukau, and gave the appearance of a front end facing towards Auckland airport. It was estimated to be at a height of approximately 2000 feet. The object appeared to have an inverted cup shape on the top, with long thin wings much bigger than a 747 aircraft. It had no engines or tail, with no visible windows. The witnesses lost sight of the object beyond tall trees for approximately 5 seconds as they turned a corner. Having negotiated the corner the object should have been clearly in view, but it had disappeared. During the 5 minute period covering the sighting, the witnesses also observed 4 aircraft in the vicinity. One of the witnesses is an aircraft worker at Auckland airport and is familiar with aircraft types. He is adamant the object sighted was not a conventional aircraft. "}
