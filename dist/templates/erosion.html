<h1>Coastal Erosion</h1><p class="intro">The coastline is always changing. Cliffs, constantly lashed by wind and rain, may be hollowed into caves, arches and pillars, then topple into the sea. Sandy shores may lose their sand to the waves, or the waves may bring even more sand to them.</p><p>Coastal erosion becomes a hazard where human activity or settlement is threatened by a temporary or permanent cutback of the shoreline. Coastal accretion is the opposite, where the shoreline builds out over time.</p><h2><span class="text">Sand vs. Rock</span></h2><p>About 70% of New Zealanders live in coastal towns and cities, most of which lie along the quarter of the countryâ€™s coast that is eroding.</p><p>The flow of water and wind on sandy beaches constantly shifts the sand from one place to another. This means that sand can be lost from a beach, or it can be washed or blown there. Waves are the main cause of erosion, and may be storm waves, boat wakes, tsunamis or tides. High waves take sand away, while flatter waves can deposit it.</p><p>Shorelines made of rock take thousands of years to wear away. When rocky beaches erode, they form cliffs. How quickly cliffs erode depends on their strength. Cliffs full of closely spaced cracks wear away quickly, and form sea caves, arches, and eventually rock pillars. Rock can be weakened by earthquakes, heavy rain, or the constant crashing of waves. Waves hitting the base of a cliff can undermine it and cause it to collapse.</p><img src="images/cathedral_cove.jpg" /><div class="sources"><h4><span class="text">Sources</span></h4><p>Images thanks to Daniel Peckham:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davaodude/6871579655/">flickr.com/photos/davaodude</a><br /><a href="http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/coastal-erosion">teara.govt.nz/en/coastal-erosion</a><br /><a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/coastal-hazards-climate-change-guidance-manual/page13.html">mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/coastal-hazards-climate-change-guidance-manual/page13.html</a><br /><a href="http://wrenz.niwa.co.nz/webmodel/coastal">wrenz.niwa.co.nz/webmodel/coastal</a></p></div>
