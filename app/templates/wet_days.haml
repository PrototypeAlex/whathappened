  Did you know the south-west coast of the South Island has mountains that trap rainfall from the westerly air stream, and allowing them to receive 2,000–10,000 millimeters of rain per year? Only the highest mountain areas of the North Island receive a similar amount of rainfall.

The above information has been based off mean monthly values of rainy days for the 1981-2010 period for locations having at least 5 complete years of data, which is why the Tasman region has no data.
