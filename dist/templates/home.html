In the previous example, just explaining that there are regions of New Zealand, and that regions contain cities may be a new piece of information for your child, and for others, finding out that it rains more in other parts of New Zealand may be just as enlightening, so long as everyone learns something then we've achieved what we set out to do. </p><p><b>Enjoy and have fun!</b></p><div class="sources"><h4><span class="text">Credits</span></h4><p>Story: Sadaf Lourie<br />Illustration: <a href="http://cargocollective.com/riccardodesign" target="_blank">Riccardo Scott</a><br />Design/Dev: <a href="http://jarredbishop.info" target="_blank">Jarred Bishop</a><br />Data/Dev: <a href="http://prototypealex.com" target="_blank">Alex Gibson</a></p></div></div></div></div>
