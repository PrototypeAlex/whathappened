  "readme": "## Latest downloadable version\n\nThe latest release of _normalize.scss is: [2.1.0](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize.css-with-sass-or-compass/archive/2.1.0.zip).\nIt combines normalize.css v2.1.0 and normalize v1.1.0.\n\n## The Compass port of normalize.css\n\n__This project is the Sass/Compass port of normalize.css.__ It aims to use the best\npartials from Compass to make normalize even easier to integrate with your\nwebsite. To learn about why Normalize.css is so amazing, skip to the\n\"normalize.css\" section below.\n\nThis Sass/Compass port currently utilizes:\n\n* Legacy IE support variables\n* CSS3 Box Sizing mixin\n* Vertical Rhythm mixins\n\nIn addition, Normalize.css has 2 major versions: version 2 (without legacy\nbrowser support) and version 1 (with support for IE 6/7, etc.) This Compass port\ncombines the two versions into one file so that you can easily toggle between\nthe two versions using Compass' `$legacy-support-for-ie7` variable.\n\nDid a client wait until the last minute to mention their CEO uses IE 7? Simply\nset `$legacy-support-for-ie7` to `true` and recompile your Sass files.\n\n# normalize.css v2.1.0\n\nNormalize.css is a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all\nelements more consistently and in line with modern standards. We researched the\ndifferences between default browser styles in order to precisely target only\nthe styles that need normalizing.\n\n[Check out the demo](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/2.1.0/test.html)\n\n## What does it do?\n\n* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.\n* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.\n* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.\n* Improves usability with subtle improvements.\n* Explains what code does using detailed comments.\n\n## How to use it\n\nNormalize.css is intended to be used as an alternative to CSS resets.\n\nIt's suggested that you read the `normalize.css` file and consider customising\nit to meet your needs. Alternatively, include the file in your project and\noverride the defaults later in your CSS.\n\nFor more information about how to use it, see the [About normalize.css article](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/).\n\nTo use the Compass port of Normalize, simply copy the _normalize.scss file to\nyour sass directory and follow the article's suggestions:\n\n* __Approach 1:__ use _normalize.scss as a starting point for your own project's\nbase Sass, customising the values to match the design's requirements. (The best\napproach, _IMO_.)\n* __Approach 2:__ include _normalize.scss untouched and build upon it, overriding\nthe defaults later in your Sass if necessary.\n\n## Browser support\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Mozilla Firefox 4+\n* Apple Safari 5+\n* Opera 12+\n* Internet Explorer 8+\n* Internet Explorer 6-7 (when `$legacy-support-for-ie7` or\n`$legacy-support-for-ie6` is set to `true`)\n\n## Contribute\n\nPlease read Necolas' [issue\nguidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines).\n\nUpdates to most CSS rules should be reported to Necolas' upstream [Normalize.css\nproject](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/). Updates to the Sass should\nbe reported in the [Normalize.css with Sass and Compass project](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize.css-with-sass-or-compass/).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nNormalize.css is a project by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas),\nco-created with [Jonathan Neal](https://github.com/jonathantneal).\n\nThis Sass/Compass port is a project by [John Albin Wilkins](http://john.albin.net).\n\n## Other ports of Normalize.css\n\nFor the record, there are several other Sass or Compass ports as well.\nIncluding:\n\n* https://github.com/waynegraham/compass-normalize-plugin\n* https://github.com/ksmandersen/compass-normalize\n* https://github.com/hail2u/normalize.scss\n* https://github.com/kristerkari/normalize.scss\n\nSome of the above projects convert normalize into Sass mixins. That makes it\nimpossible to add Normalize using __Approach 1__ (by copying the file into your website\nand customizing/overriding for your needs.)\n",
