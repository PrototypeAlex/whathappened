  Unidentified Flying Objects

%p.intro
  It could just be a cloud, or it could be something far more interesting; UFO reports in New Zealand are more common than you'd think. Although the New Zealand Defence Force does not take an official interest in UFO reports, in December 2010 it released previously secret files on hundreds of purported UFO reports. Of those the most widely reported incident, and the only one investigated, involved the Kaikoura lights seen by a pilot in 1978.
